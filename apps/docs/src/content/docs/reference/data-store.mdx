Loop Decoder relies on two Data Stores - `AbiStore` and `ContractMetadataStore`. These stores are used for:

- Retrieving and caching data
- Fetching data from external sources using [Data Loaders](../data-loaders) (when not available in the cache)

The Data Store can be customized to suit different needs. Here are some common use cases and implementations:

- In-memory store: The simplest option, ideal for testing and development, available in Built-in Stores.
- Persistent store: Ideal for production environment and when you work with a large number of contracts that you do not know in advance. The store can get and set data to any external database. `SQL` is available in Built-in Stores.
- Static mapping: For applications that work with a fixed set of contracts, the store can get data from a hardcoded set of ABIs and metadata.
- REST API client: For browser-based applications, enabling ABI and contract metadata retrieval from a server

A store also requires a set of strategies that we cover separately in the [Data Loaders](../data-loaders) section.

### Built-in Stores

Loop Decoder provides two stores that can be used out of the box:

#### 1. In-memory stores (Vanilla JS API)

Located at `@3loop/transaction-decoder/in-memory`, ideal for testing and development purposes.

- `InMemoryAbiStore` - caches the resolved ABI in memory
- `InMemoryContractMetaStore` - caches the resolved contract metadata in memory

[See the Getting Started guide for a detailed example](/welcome/getting-started/).

#### 2. SQL stores (Effect API)

Located at `@3loop/transaction-decoder/sql`, a persistent store that can be used in production for enhancing the performance of the decoder. While using this store, you do not need to write your own database schema, and `get` or `set` methods.

- `SqlAbiStore` - caches the resolved ABI in any SQL database supported by `@effect/sql`
- `SqlContractMetaStore` - caches the resolved contract metadata in any SQL database supported by `@effect/sql`

[See the Decoding Transaction with SQLite Data Store guide](/guides/sql-stores).

## Custom Data Stores (Effect API)

### Implementation example

Custom SQL stores with Effect API - Decoder API, [ABI Store](https://github.com/3loop/decoder-api/blob/87bec4e70b9df36b62e8d2cf78721a7304e84ed6/src/decoder/abi-loader.ts) and [Contract Metadata Store](https://github.com/3loop/decoder-api/blob/87bec4e70b9df36b62e8d2cf78721a7304e84ed6/src/decoder/meta-loader.ts)

### AbiStore

The full interface of ABI store is:

<EffectABI />

ABI Store Interface requires 2 methods: `set` and `get` to store and retrieve the ABI of a contract. Optionally, you can provide a batch get method `getMany` for further optimization. Because our API supports ABI fragments, the get method will receive both the contract address and the fragment signature.

```typescript
interface AbiParams {
  chainID: number
  address: string
  event?: string | undefined // event signature
  signature?: string | undefined // function signature
}
```

The `set` method will receive a key of the type `AbiParams` and and `ContractAbiResult`. You can choose to store the data in the best format that fits your database.

```typescript
interface FunctionFragmentABI {
  type: 'func'
  abi: string
  address: string
  chainID: number
  signature: string
}

interface EventFragmentABI {
  type: 'event'
  abi: string
  address: string
  chainID: number
  event: string
}

interface AddressABI {
  type: 'address'
  abi: string
  address: string
  chainID: number
}

export type ContractABI = FunctionFragmentABI | EventFragmentABI | AddressABI

export interface ContractAbiSuccess {
  status: 'success'
  result: ContractABI
}

export interface ContractAbiNotFound {
  status: 'not-found'
  result: null
}

export interface ContractAbiEmpty {
  status: 'empty'
  result: null
}

export type ContractAbiResult = ContractAbiSuccess | ContractAbiNotFound | ContractAbiEmpty
```

### ContractMetadataStore

The full interface of Contract Metadata Store is:

<EffectMeta />

Similar to the ABI Store, the Contract Metadata Store Interface requires 2 methods `set`, `get`, and optionally `getMany` to store and retrieve the contract metadata.

The `get` method will receive the contract address and the chain ID as input.

```typescript
interface ContractMetaParams {
  address: string
  chainID: number
}
```

And, the `set` method will be called with 2 pramaters, the key in the same format as the `get` method, and the metadata in a format of `ContractMetaResult`.

```typescript
interface ContractMetaSuccess {
  status: 'success'
  result: ContractData
}

interface ContractMetaNotFound {
  status: 'not-found'
  result: null
}

interface ContractMetaEmpty {
  status: 'empty'
  result: null
}

export type ContractMetaResult = ContractMetaSuccess | ContractMetaNotFound | ContractMetaEmpty
```

Contract metadata is a map of the following interface:

```typescript
export interface ContractData {
  address: string
  contractName: string
  contractAddress: string
  tokenSymbol: string
  decimals?: number
  type: ContractType
  chainID: number
}
```

### Stored Statuses

You can notice that the `AbiStore` and `ContractMetadataStore` interfaces are very similar, and both have a status for the set and get methods. Both stores can return three states:

1. `success` - The requested data is found in the store.
2. `not-found` - The requested data is found in the store, but is missing a value. This means that we have tried to resolve it from a third party, but it was missing there.
3. `empty` - The requested data is not found in the store, which means that it has never been requested before.

We have two states that can return an empty result - `not-found` and `empty`. We want to be able to skip the Data Loader strategy in cases where we know it's not available (`not-found` state), as this can significantly reduce the number of requests and improve performance.

It is possible that a `not-found` item will become available later in the future. Therefore, we encourage storing a `timestamp` and removing the `not-found` items to be able to check them again.

## Custom Data Stores (Vanilla JS API)

### Differences from Effect API

The Vanilla JS API for defining custom data stores differs from the Effect API in the following ways:

- The `get` method is a JS async function (vs Effect TS generator function)
- The `set` method is a JS async function (vs Effect TS generator function)
- The `getMany` method is not supported

Everything else, including received and returned types, is the same as in the Effect API.
