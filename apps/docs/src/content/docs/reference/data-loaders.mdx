Data Loaders are mechanisms for retrieving the necessary ABI and Contract Metadata for transaction decoding. They are responsible for:

- Resolving ABIs and Contract Metadata using specified strategies and third-party APIs
- Automatically batching requests and deduplicating identical lookups during parallel log/trace processing
- Caching results and negative lookups in the [Data Store](/reference/data-store)
- Applying rate limits, circuit breaking, and adaptive concurrency via a shared request pool

Loop Decoder implements optimizations to minimize API requests to third-party services. For example, when a contractâ€™s ABI is resolved via Etherscan, it is cached in the store. If the ABI is requested again, the store provides the cached version, avoiding redundant API calls. When a source returns no result, a `not-found` entry can be stored to skip repeated attempts temporarily.

## ABI Strategies

ABI strategies will receive the contract address, and event or function signature as input and would return the ABI as a stringified JSON. Loop Decoder provides some strategies out of the box:

- `EtherscanStrategyResolver` - resolves the ABI from Etherscan, requires an API key to work properly
- `EtherscanV2StrategyResolver` - resolves the ABI from Etherscan v2, requires an API key to work properly
- `SourcifyStrategyResolver` - resolves the ABI from Sourcify
- `FourByteStrategyResolver` - resolves the ABI from 4byte.directory
- `OpenchainStrategyResolver` - resolves the ABI from Openchain
- `BlockscoutStrategyResolver` - resolves the ABI from Blockscout

You can create your strategy by implementing the `GetContractABIStrategy` Effect RequestResolver.

## Contract Metadata Strategies

Contract metadata is a collection of information about a contract, such as the contract's name, symbol, and decimals.

Loop Decoder provides some strategies out of the box:

- `ERC20RPCStrategyResolver` - resolves the contract metadata of an ERC20 token from the RPC
- `NFTRPCStrategyResolver` - resolves the contract metadata of an NFT token (ERC721, ERC1155) from the RPC
- `ProxyRPCStrategyResolver` - resolves the contract metadata of a Gnosis Safe proxy contract from the RPC

## Code Examples

### Initializing ABI Strategies

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Effect API">
```typescript
const AbiStoreLive = SqlAbiStore.make({
  default: [
    EtherscanV2StrategyResolver({
      apikey: process.env.ETHERSCAN_API_KEY,
    }),
    FourByteStrategyResolver(),
  ],
  //...
})
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Vanilla JS API">
```typescript
const abiStore: VanillaAbiStore = {
  strategies: [
    EtherscanStrategyResolver({
      apikey: process.env.ETHERSCAN_API_KEY || '',
    }),
    FourByteStrategyResolver(),
  ],
  //...
}
```
  </TabItem>

### Initializing Contract Metadata Strategies

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Effect API">
```typescript
const MetaStoreLive = Layer.unwrapEffect(
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const service = yield* PublicClient

    return SqlContractMetaStore.make({
      default: [ERC20RPCStrategyResolver(service), NFTRPCStrategyResolver(service)],
    })

}),
)
